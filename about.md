Hi, my name is Jean Carlo Machado. I'm a 24 years old, lead engineer at
[CompuFÃ¡cil](http://compufacil.com.br/), a financial management startup
that focuses on user experience and simplicity. I specially care about
science and open-source. I'm a citizen of the world. 

Currently I'm researching optimization based on nature inspired
intelligence. I also enjoy the Unix way, functional programming, clean
code and violin.

Below are some of my breadcrumbs on the Web.
