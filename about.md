I'm in love with science and technology.

I speak on software conferences and give courses on technologies I'm passionate about.

On my spare time I read, write and play music.

A garage philosopher.

An evolved denizen of middle world.

A citizen of the world.

A honesty aficionado.

Below are some of my breadcrumbs on the Web.
