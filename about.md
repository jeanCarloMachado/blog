I'm a senior backend engineer at GYG.

I'm in love with science and technology.

I speak on software conferences and give courses on technologies I'm passionate about.

On my spare time I read, write and play the violin.

A garage philosopher.

An evolved denizen of middle world.

A citizen of the world.

A honesty aficionado.


    For my part, I will not give in to fear of the unknown. We all have our
    role to play, and I hope only that when I have played mine, the world
    will have been better for my having been in it.
