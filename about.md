More? There you have!


    I hate poetry about love
    From the beauty virgin
    To the perfect prince
    What a shallow occupation

    The stars, the quasars
    The neutrinos, the quarks

    The algorithm and the genome
    Calculus and the neuron

    Nature demands our attention
    To wonder in it's secrets, a life's occupation!

    Jean Carlo Machado

    Make sure you remain straightforward, upright,
    reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind,
    affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the
    person philosophy tried to make you.

    Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

    For my part, I will not give in to fear of the unknown.
    We all have our role to play
    And I hope only that when I have played mine
    The world will have been better for my having been in it.
