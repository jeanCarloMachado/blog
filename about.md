I'm a senior backend engineer at GYG.

I'm in love with science and technology.

I speak on software conferences and give courses on technologies I'm passionate about.

On my spare time I read, write and play the violin.

A garage philosopher.

An evolved denizen of middle world.

A citizen of the world.

A honesty aficionado.


    I hate poetry about love
    From the beauty virgin
    To the perfect prince
    What a shallow occupation

    The stars, the quasars
    The neutrinos, the quarks

    The algorithm and the genome
    Calculus and the neuron

    Nature demands our attention
    To wonder in it's secrets, a life's occupation!
