title: Prototyping with Calc
---

Yesterday I had to work on an very hard task related to the payment
system of Compuf√°cil. I was struggling with some scenarios so it was suggested
for we to prototype the values with Calc.

I thought it was strange at first. Imagine prototyping in Calc!

The old school wizardry is used to use interpreted language for this
purpose. New times, today I develop the final application on an
interpreted language and use an office suite for prototyping!

But after some time working on it I became to consider Calc as valuable
prototyping asset.

But now I desire better tools, I hate suites. The need: prototyping in a really
fast manner, where is possible to build simple GUI's with simple logic in int.
But it has to be as fast as Calc.
