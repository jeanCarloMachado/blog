title: The last responsible moment
---

Usually we are faced with decisions we have to make. But often this
decisions are not essential right when they appear.

I'm hear to defend that we delay this decisions the most we can to
take the decision.

This is because the nature of our operations - as software engineers,
and as people living in a complex world - politics tend to change. Late
are the moments when a great amount of requirements show up.

So the wisest thing to do is to wait until the last moment that you can
act on the problem. The so called: last responsible moment. So chances
are that we have the greater amount of knowledge one can get to do
whatever we need to.

As lazy as it may sound, this serves me well generally.
