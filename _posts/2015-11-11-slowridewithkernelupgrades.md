title: Slow ride with kernel upgrades
---

Since Kernel 4 my life got harder. By random kernel panics,
decrease in battery duration and problems with slow Qt
applications.

This resume seems pretty little, but having experienced this
problems and tried to solve them by my own is a lot worse.
So I decided to downgrade my Kernel, right now I'm on:

```
uname -a
Linux JeanArch 3.14.52-1-lts #1 SMP Thu Sep 17 20:31:50 CEST 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

And no problems this. My life is so much easier. Now I can even
get bigger uptimes!

So from now own, I'll  be no longer hasty about kernel upgrades. 
I think the only acceptable reason a user would prefer
a non lts release is to get some new drivers to unsupported
hardware. But beyond that it just to harden one's life.

And experiencing Archlinux for more than one year for now,
I feel like this is the main reason Arch is considered an sort of
unstable SO. I users might have another perception if there
we're some REALLY lts kernels officially supported.
