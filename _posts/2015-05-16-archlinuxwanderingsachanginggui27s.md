title: Archlinux wanderings changing GUI's
---


This week I moved from LXDE to Openbox-only, and I'm quite happy with it. For considerable time I've been looking for a more decoupled way of "desktopping". I didn't realized that what was missing was a task launcher, just by accident I found [synapse](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/synapse/) in a Archlinux group, and finally understood LXDE was redundant for me. I didn't have to learn anything new because I've been using LXDE in a very hardcore way, dealing with config files directly, practically Openbox itself - which was installed under the hood.

Now, going to the main point, I find out extremely easy to migrate (the installation) from one to another with Arch. With other Linux distributions, say: Ubuntu, it's extremely difficult to make a clean installation of a GUI differently of those the software vendors pre-installed; you will probably end up with redundancy and conflicting files. Arch is diffenrent, I took the most intuitive way possible - simply uninstalled LXDE and installed Openbox - and it simply worked, no conflicts, a clean installation. This is the magic of empowering the user, to let the users do wherever they want and to do not "improve" for the sake of the distribution third party sofware packages. This is the [Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way) in action, and I'm quite happy with it.

Beyond that I already have installed, on the same Arch, [Xmonad](http://www.google.com.br/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fxmonad.org%2F&ei=TeNXVfDuO6bLsASVp4HwDg&usg=AFQjCNE0QNdZxNKScXML_mHNQKEO9yxfnw&bvm=bv.93564037,d.cWc). A tiling window manager that, one day, I intend to use as my main GUI.

For those interested on my setup, currently the software stack I'm using for desktop is this:
- Openbox;
- Synapse (task laucher);
- Nitrogen (wallpaper setting);
- Tint2  (task bar);
- Conky;
- Thunar (file manager);
- Vim;
- urxvt (console);
- netctl (network cofiguration);
- cmus and Spotify
- Firefox (beyond browser I use it as a pdf viewer too);


That's it, if you like, have any doubt, or piece of advice to give me, please don't hesitate in commenting!
