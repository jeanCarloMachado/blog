title: On being a 50 years old programmer
keywords: Programming

In the struggle of being a more mindful human being I resolved to make a
"future self introspection" about the things I invest my time. This post
is part of that reflection, I would like to answer the question: what
myself with 30, 40 years would like for the Jean of right now to invest
his time?

What will I think when I'm with 30? or 40? Certainly I will like for the
me of today to adopt technology and concepts which lasts. The forties
Jean will not be happy if he has to learn a new way of doing the same
every week.

It's not a lazy thing say, there are so much things to learn in
Computer Science that the one which stays changing the way of
doing the same is simply plain unaligned with learning.

And what exactly is technology that lasts?
Seems to me that technology that lasts has some traits.

Traits of enduring technology
-----------------------------

- Tradition or replicability through out history
- Driven by committee (ISO like) or a benevolent dictator
- Disruptive productivity results
- Has pedigree, some very well known leader

Probably no technology will apply all those traits, but the one's that
apply some of them successfully will probably be a good deal to bet on
it's long term success.

Some of them that came to mind:

Technologies
------------

***
- Bash and binutils (replicability, productivity)
- Unix like operational systems (replicability)
- C programming language (pedigree, driven by committee)
- SQL (committee)
- Vim (tradition, productivity)
- Haskell  (committee)
- Git (pedigree, disruptive productivity)
***


Beyond technology, probably it's good for the forties Jean to
focus on concepts, they tend to stand much longer than
technologies.

Concepts
--------

***
- Stateless
- Design by contract
- Inversion of dependencies
- Test driven development
- Unix like services (micro-services)
- Architecture in general
- IA
- Algorithms in general
- Security
- Performance and optimization
- Containerization
- Computer Science theory in general
***

Much of the rest, seems to me, are trends and will fade away, much
of the "high tech" we see now will probably fade, the way we building
interfaces will most certainly fade, all those novel programming
language that just has some new syntax sugar will (probably) fade as
well.

I just hope I can adhere to this principles the most I can so to be able
to remain as an relevant developer in the years to come.
