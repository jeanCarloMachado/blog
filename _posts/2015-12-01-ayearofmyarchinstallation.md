title: A year of my Arch installation
---

I've been with the same installation of a Archlinux more than a year now.

```
sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda2 | grep created
Filesystem created:       Fri Oct 10 09:14:32 2014
```
It may seem not a big deal but by my SO's perspective probably this
is the longest strike on the same distro.

It was - as usual - a not easy year, but undoubtedly it was a fun
one. Many times I broke things, but not even once I was unable to log
back.

## Things that are yet broken

The web cam is broken, there's a project to solve it but it's not
finished yet. And probably it will never be, cause we depend
upon the good will for liberating the specification.

Kernel 4 is unstable for me and the Qt applications are barely
usable. So for now I'm running an older lts version, following my
philosophy of [slow riding kernel
upgrades](http://jeancarlomachado.com.br/#!/post/134).

This is in fact a partial true. It was certainly true right after
the Kernel 4 release and it's first minors. Now Qt applications are
normally usable. And Kernel 4 improved a lot in stability
but yet it's far from the 3.15 version in my experience.

## Awesome things

My desktop is incredible for my experience, totally customized and
fitted for me, it answers to my unique requirements.
With it I fell like I'm practising the perfect continuous
improvement.

I'm a full Unix guy since I'm using Arch. Now I'm a full time vim
user, together with tmux and lots of other scripts my usage is
simply ingenious.

My battery duration is greater then on OSX. If I take care of
what I'm using I can take it to 15 hours.

Arch is about responsibility, the system will never grow outdated,
so is up to the user to keep it fresh (don't messing up with things).

My system is pretty robust, and there's no problem that I cannot tackle
(beyond those already listed). This is partly about responsibility
already mentioned. I now find really essential a extensive documentation
about the software I use, and it gives me insights far beyond those
simply "users" have.

Yet following the responsibility principle, started doing almost daily
backups with the really useful rsync.

## The future

If I don't mess up critically (and it's backup) I'll continue
working with this installation till the end of times.

I really feel on solid ground with Arch and the power it enables
it's users. Thanks Archlinux community!
