title: When it is worth to cry
---

When was the last time you cried? I'm not ashamed to say that I am
frequently moved to tears. Yet I cannot bring to memory the last time I
suffered to the point of crying - probably many years ago.

It's too common to associate the experience of crying with suffering.
Sadly there's too many people without luck in this world which may very
well have all the reasons to cry their miseries. And this people need
our help. But if you are the average person in this world - not having
to fight starvation or being on a hospital bed half conscious. I have
something to tell you.

I think it is possible to live a life of frequent crying, not out of
suffering, but of joy.

The first thing I recalled crying out of joy was at the wonders I was
introduced by the original cosmos series. There's something in Carl
Sagan's way of viewing the world that resonates profoundly with me. Even
nowadays if I listen to the serie's music or watch one of my favorite
episodes I'm moved to tears.

Poetry may very well impact-me in a similar fashion, Othello will
forever live in my heart. The stoicism of Marcus Aurelius. The
profundity of Goethe's view of life. The symmetries of mathematics. Some
pieces of music: Vivaldi, Bach and James Horner's Breavehearth's theme.
Some gospel songs (although I'm an atheist) do touch me.
Even the mundane pleasure's of The Lord of the Rings.

A breeze of wind altogether with a deep breath. A sunlight.

I strongly suspect that one of the main drivers of this susceptibility
is meditation. Far more important than the secular benefits of
the practice, the reason I do it is to achieve inner peace. And this
peace allows me to expand my circle of sympathy and connection. By the way
this is no magic - some drugs can also have the same effect.

It is also necessary a clear examination of our predicament. To cry
out of joy you don't need new landscapes, just new eyes. All the
improbabilities that amount for us to be here and now is the only
miracle worth the name.

The unbelievable luck we have to have being born, out of billions
of other combinations biology could have produced. The staggering
improbability of such a majestic universe governed by precise and
discoverable laws. The fact we are made out of the waste of dying starts
blowing up as supernovas. We are the universe. We are a way of the
universe to discover itself.

Some people find it unpleasant to talk about death. I feel the opposite.
It's precisely the finite nature of our existence that makes it so
precious. Be mindful of these things in your days and I challenge not to
cry. Enjoy your moment in the Sun.
