title: Refactoring must be a constant
---

In [this](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html)
genial post Martin talks about the importance of refactoring.

It's not an solid process that should have allocated time for it.

Refactoring is a concurrent activity to the development of new features.

Obviously one must have all green tests to do so.

Feature branches should not be an impediment to refactoring, the
developer must maintain the mindset that refactoring is sacrate

When I grow big I wanna be like you Martin.
