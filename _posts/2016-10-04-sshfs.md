With sshfs one can mount some remote folders on it's host using the SSH
protocol.

I discovered this little tool while trying to setup a stack for
developing a GPU algorithm directly inside Amazon - since I don't have
a GPU in my machine. From back then I incorporated it as a
debugging tool for Compuf√°cil and I'm really pleased with it.

The main point in using it is that after the file system is mounted
one can use it's editor in a local buffer (without delays) to do
one's debugging/development stuff. Beyond performance, One can even use all
the magic of it's local editor, without having to be stuck with some
remote vanilla vim.


Mount the file system
--------------------

```
sshfs $USER@$SERVER_IP:$REMOTE_FOLDER $LOCAL_FOLDER -o IdentityFile=$MY_PEM_FILE
```

Umount the file system
---------------------
```
fusermount -u $LOCAL_FOLDER
```

I also read that it can be used as entry on /etc/fstab to automatize the mounting the process. If you liked the tool I recommend the [excellent documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS) on Arch's wiki.
