title: Finding issues on Github
---

This is a small post about a straight forward way of one becoming a
ninja on seeking Github Issues. A invaluable skill for great
developers wannabe.

The magic consists in going on [this link](https://github.com/issues) and filling the input like this:

```
is:issue org:doctrine
```

To get a list of all open issues in any Doctrine project. Now to filter
the issues for labels or status one can use:

```
is:issue org:zendframework is:open label:EasyFix 
```


That's it. If you know any other trick of mastering issues on
Github let me know.
