For checking that the submitted code passes the tests we use
Buildkite on Compuf√°cil.

The nice thing about Buildkite is the flexibility to run it
everywery in any hardware. But the fact of having to configure it
on each machine is a drahback on it's stack.

Running docker inside docker
----------------------------


To run docker inside docker in a professional way, one can share
the host socket with the client like this:

```
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \

```

Sharing ssh sockets
-------------------


```
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add $RSA_FILE

--volume $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-agent \
--env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent \

```
