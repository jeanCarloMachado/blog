Is pretty common to see companies list their core values. But you rarely
see individuals doing that. For me the later is even more important.
Know thyself in order to direct the boat of life.

 - Knowledge
 - Impact
 - Honesty
 - Mindfulness
 - Goodness


## Knowledge

This is the higher on my list. More than learning I value knowledge.
There's nothing in this life more noble than understanding. Nothing more
poetic than the reality underneath our eyes and science is the portal
for it's discovery.


    The deepest solace lies in understanding,
    This ancient unseen stream,
    A shudder before the beautiful

    Richard Dawkins

## Honesty

Being truth to oneself and to others - no matter what. This approach
enables a new way of life, very distinct of what people are used to. And
probably there's no better way to build durable and happy relationships.

## Goodness

To focus in improving things a bit around me.


## Impact

It matters much more when you use the knowledge you have in order to
improve the world in some way. This is also pretty important for me.


## Awareness

The other values impose a big "burden" to carry and it's easy to feel overwhelmed.
Mindfulness is key to keep sanity on the journey. This value also correlates with introspection, and self-criticism.
The ability recognize failures, and to adapt.


That's enough exposure for today. If you want to truly connect share yours with me!
